# OpenCV-Object Detection
Computer vision - Object Detection with OpenCV and Python

This project is based on the object detection using OpenCV. 
It works in a way such that it detects objects above a given threshold value.
By changing threshold value, we can adjust the objects to be detected. 
Here gaussian filter is used, you can try someother filters.
